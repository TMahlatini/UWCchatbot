      "Nestled at the foot of the Blue Mountains in Walla Walla, Washington, you’ll find a place like no other. Whitman College is a top-tier liberal arts school with accomplished and friendly faculty and passionate and curious students. Here, you can find endless support and opportunities in and outside the classroom—becoming your best self.\n",
      "From the moment you arrive on our beautiful campus, you’ll belong to a community that challenges you, supports you and wants the best for you. You’ll matter here—and you’ll make a difference.\n",
      " \r\n",
      "\t\tThe natural world undeniably shapes and is shaped by humans. To understand and influence this interaction for the better, you need the intellectual and practical tools to study environmental issues from multiple points of view. The Environmental Studies majors at Whitman College brings science and the humanities together in a flexible, unique academic path that will give you the tools to make a difference as a global citizen.\r\n",

      "My favorite thing about Whitman is going to sound pretty cheesy and broad, but I like the culture. It feels like a safe place for students to really try new things and become passionate in all sorts of different things. There is definitely a level of competition because it’s a very good school, but there’s also, everywhere you go, just a culture of support and really helping each other which I think is probably pretty unique to Whitman.  \n",

You’ll take part in experiences and community activities, so that you’re prepared to build with confidence and lead with compassion in later life.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’ve built our educational model on a set of principles that aim to help you reach your potential - academically, morally, socially and emotionally. Our schools each have their own distinct identity, but they’re united by these common values:\\nWe’ve built our approach and curriculum on these principles, and have inspired thousands to find the skills and confidence to spark change.\\nAfter UWC, you’ll be able to progress to your chosen university, or to the calling that suits you.\\xa0\\nYou’ll leave here with a strong academic foundation. But also a stronger understanding of yourself, the world around you, and the power to help others.\\nIt’s an education, built differently.\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - UWC History & Founding Ideas\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/history\\nThis idea has been at the heart of what we do at UWC, ever since our first school was founded in 1962.\\nWe believe that education can be about more than just personal advancement, or securing a place at university.\\xa0It can inspire students to discover what connects us all as humans, and to act as champions for a world of peace, collaboration and understanding.\\n\"I regard it as the foremost task of education to ensure the survival of these qualities: an enterprising curiosity, an undefeatable spirit, tenacity in pursuit, readiness for sensible self-denial, and - above all - compassion.\"\\n- Kurt Hahn (Founder of UWC)\\nIn 1955, educational pioneer Kurt Hahn delivered a speech at the NATO Defense College in Paris. During his visit, he was inspired by the cooperation and loyalty shown by military men who had very recently been on opposite sides in World War Two.\\nHahn had already been involved in the founding of a number of schools and education organisations, and his ideas on education were constantly evolving. At the time, he talked frequently about the power of education as a route to peace, as well as a need to reverse the “decline of compassion” in society.\\nIt was through the convergence of these ideas that UWC was eventually born.\\xa0\\nIn a 1958 speech, he said:\\nIn 1962, UWC Atlantic (originally called Atlantic College) in Wales, United Kingdom, admitted its first students. The first UWC school was built on the idea that if young people from different backgrounds were educated together, they could build an understanding which could prevent future conflicts.\\nIt was the world’s first international, two-year Sixth Form College for teenagers aged 16 to 19.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nIt was a place where they would learn the empathy that enabled them to listen, and consider other perspectives, even if they were very different to their own. They would learn the strength to stand for what was right, even if the risk was great. And they would learn to be resilient, and to learn from mistakes rather than give up.\\nFrom the earliest days of Atlantic College, there was a desire to replicate the model. It was the height of the Cold War, and many saw the benefits of an idea that valued connection, compassion and service. By the end of the 1960s, the United World Colleges name had been coined, and a movement started to become a reality.\\nUWC’s first international president, Lord Mountbatten, helped the UWC movement develop beyond its North Atlantic roots. He oversaw the foundation of national committees, which would select students and promote UWC in different countries. In years to come, UWC schools would appear in Singapore and Canada, and later in continents across the world.\\nUWC has always been about listening, and learning. It has evolved and grown in line with the needs of its communities and the world around it. And its commitment to peace, understanding and resilience remains as strong as ever.\\xa0\\nThere are 18\\xa0UWC schools and colleges.\\nWe are represented in more than 150 countries through our national committees.\\nOver 60,000 students from over 180 countries have studied at UWC schools and colleges and on our short course programmes.\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - About the UWC Zimbabwe NC\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/page/?title=About+the+UWC+Zimbabwe+NC&pid=3419\\nThe UWC Zimbabwe National Committee is a group of dedicated volunteers. The NC is responsible for selecting Zimbabwean students to attend UWC schools and then providing support for those students while they are at UWC.\\nIn recent years the Zimbabwe NC has also begun to work to connect UWC Zimbabwe alumni who are living locally and in the diaspora, to develop a network of individuals who are committed to social change both in Zimbabwe and around the world.

To open their minds to new perspectives, and discover new skills and talents.\\nIt’s a rigorous experience, but it’s one that could change how you see the world.\\nRead on to find out how you can take on this experience through either the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (16-19 year-olds), International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (16-19 year olds) or Younger Years programme (2-15 year-olds).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMost students attending UWC between the ages of 16 and 19 take the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), which is offered at all UWC schools and colleges. It’s a challenging curriculum that allows students to explore a range of subjects and ideas, while learning about the importance of activity and service in the community.\\nIn fact, UWC played a key role in crafting the IBDP back in the 1960s, and the ties between the IB Organisation and UWC remain close decades later.\\nThe IBDP aims to “encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.” It’s respected in the best universities worldwide for its focus on service, communication, teamwork, leadership and critical thinking.\\n\"Although the IBDP was quite overwhelming at times and there was a lot to be learned, overall it made me a lot more confident and taught me how to study. My first year at college felt much easier than my second year of IBDP. I’m much more sure of the things I say because I research them, and I’m so much better at writing.\"\\n- Leonor, UWC Mahindra College alumna\\nIBDP students choose a course from each of the following six subject areas:\\nStudents generally study three subjects at standard level and three subjects at a higher level. At a higher level they are expected to demonstrate a greater body of knowledge, understanding and skills. Subjects may vary between UWC schools, often reflecting their geographic location and focus areas.\\nAs well as the six subject areas, students complete three core parts of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme which are central to the philosophy of the programme. These are:\\nStudents investigate a topic of special interest, and develop the independent research and writing skills required at university level. The essay is typically written in one of the student’s six subject groups and must be no more than 4,000 words in length. Students are supported in the research and writing process by an academic supervisor.\\nThe course encourages students to reflect on the nature of knowledge, on how we know what we claim to know. It is assessed through an oral presentation and a 1,600-word essay.\\nTaking responsibility, developing social, creative and outdoor skills, as well as learning to approach others with empathy are at the heart of the programme. Students engage in a variety of projects that aim to help them develop these skills, while at the same time actively engaging with their local community.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAlongside the IBDP, some UWC schools and colleges also offer students aged 16 to 19 the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP).\\xa0\\nLike the IBDP, the IBCP is a rigorous educational programme that prepares students with the skills and knowledge to make a difference now and in their future, whatever they choose to do next. And just like the IBDP, it is a curriculum that is highly valued by universities worldwide.\\xa0\\nWhat makes the IBCP unique is that - unlike the IBDP - it offers students the opportunity to specialise in a specific field. If you have a desire to pursue a certain career or gain skills and hands-on experience in a particular area, this might be the right path for you.\\xa0\\nIBCP students undertake a minimum of two IBDP courses, a career-related study and an IBCP core:\\xa0\\nWithin the IBCP programme framework, Pearson College UWC\\xa0developed its unique two-year Climate Action Leadership Diploma (CALD), tailored to students with a passion for addressing climate change and environmental stewardship. Alongside taking two to three IBDP courses, CALD students embark on climate action leadership studies developed in conjunction with regional universities. The programme\\xa0incorporates place-based and Indigenous knowledge and environmental stewardship as well as bespoke programming, microcredentials and field school. CALD students are full members of the Pearson College UWC community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path.\\xa0\\nWithin the IBCP programme framework, UWC Maastricht has designed multiple pathways in partnership with reputable institutions:\\nIBCP students are full members of the UWC Maastricht community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path. IBCP students are also encouraged to further develop their talents through student-led initiatives, conferences, social entrepreneurship programmes, community services, outdoor learning, project weeks and music lessons.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA number of UWC schools and colleges welcome students from younger age groups, ranging from 2 to 15 years old. These younger years programmes run in addition to the IBDP that is offered at all UWC schools and colleges for learners aged 16-19.\\xa0\\nStudents in the younger years are immersed in age-appropriate educational programmes that align with UWC’s mission to make education a force for peace and a sustainable future.\\nAcademically, they are equipped for the rigours of the IBDP at UWC, should that be the path they follow later on their educational journey. But far beyond this, students from 2 to 15 learn to be active, aware contributors in their school, their local communities and in wider society through hands-on, values-driven and holistic learning programmes. They are emboldened to question, create and engage, and to develop strong social, emotional and creative skills for their lives beyond UWC.\\xa0\\nMost UWC schools with younger years provision have a mix of residential and non-residential students on campus. The age at which students can begin living on campus as boarding students depends on each school. This means that campus spaces are shared between those who attend classes but live with their families outside of campus and those who live in one of the residencies on campus. When it comes to those UWC schools that exclusively offer high school programmes for the 15-19 age range, all students live and learn together on campus as boarding students.\\xa0\\nUWC Changshu China welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. The school offers 15 year-olds the opportunity to enrol in a one-year long Foundation Programme in preparation for the IBDP (16-19 year-olds).\\xa0\\nUWC East Africa welcomes students between the ages of 3 and 20 on its two campuses, Arusha and Moshi. The school offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-11 year-olds, the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-20 year-olds. While Moshi Campus hosts both day students and boarding students for all three programmes, Arusha Campus accepts day students enrolled in the PYP and MYP, and both day students and boarding students in the IBDP years.\\xa0\\nUWC ISAK Japan welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. 15 year-old students can join the school as part of its 3-year high school programme, which emphasizes its flagship Leadership Programme in Grade 10, before merging with the 2-year IBDP in Grade 11 (16-19 year-olds).\\xa0\\xa0\\nUWC Maastricht welcomes students between the ages of 4 and 19. UWC Maastricht Primary School caters to 4-11 year-olds, while UWC Maastricht Secondary School offers the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP\\xa0and the IBCP\\xa0to 16-19 year-olds. The majority of UWC Maastricht\\'s students are day students and they live with their families in the region. Only IBDP and IBCP\\xa0students can live on campus as part of the residential programme, and most of them do.\\xa0\\nUWC South East Asia welcomes day and boarding students aged 4-18 years to two campuses, Dover and East. UWC South East Asia\\'s concept-based K-12 curriculum prepares students of all ages for their future by linking their learning in universal concepts to their real-world experiences in Singapore. New students can join the school at any grade in Primary (4-11 years), Middle (12-14 years) or High School (15-17 years), and can graduate with both a UWCSEA High School Diploma and an IB Diploma.\\nUWC Thailand welcomes students between 2 and 18 years of age. The Early Years Programme consists of play-based learning for the youngest students who are between 2 and 5 years old. The school also offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-12 year-olds, the IB Middle Year Programme (MYP)\\xa0to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-19 year-olds. The boarding programme at UWC Thailand is open to students in grades 9-12, which cover the last two years of MYP and the IBDP. Day students are eligible to enroll at all grade levels if they are full-time residents in Phuket.\\xa0\\nWaterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa welcomes day and boarding students between the ages of 11 and 19. Students aged 11-15 attend Lower Secondary School and follow the school’s own curriculum. Students aged 15-17 are offered the Cambridge IGCSE programme, and students aged 17-19 study the IBDP.\\xa0\\nPlease note that attending a UWC school during the younger years does not automatically grant students a place at UWC to study the IBDP later in life. All schools offering younger years programmes carefully monitor each individual student\\'s progress to ensure that the rigorous IBDP followed as part of the two-year programme for 16-19 year-olds is the right course of study for them.\\xa0\\nPlease contact the school of your choice for more information about younger years provision.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/cocurricular\\n“We’re giving students a formative experience by putting them on a journey of discovery. My 17-year-old self had no clue who I was. The greatest gift we’re giving them is an understanding of their place in the world, and an opportunity to realise their own visions.”\\xa0\\n- Christian Bock, Academic Director & IB Coordinator, UWC Robert Bosch College, Germany\\nMany schools worldwide now study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, a curriculum that promotes creativity, activity and service.\\nBut we take its principles further.\\nOur diverse school communities encourage students to explore different perspectives with their fellow classmates, rather than just learning them from books.\\nWe explore the art and culture of our surroundings first-hand, and consider how creativity and imagination can help us understand and change the world.\\nAnd our focus on community service goes far beyond fulfilling the IBDP requirements or boosting students\\' university applications. We help students discover causes that matter to them, and learn how to turn them into initiatives, projects and activities that can help those around them for many years after they have left their UWC school and co-curricular activities behind.\\nThis means that, as a UWC student, you’ll build habits that aren’t just for school, but for life.\\nOur co-curricular activities vary by school, because it will be the specific surroundings of your UWC school that will determine the activities that are possible and the service initiatives that are needed.\\n\\n\\n- Ramila Patel, Head of Visual Arts, Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa\\nArt and creativity aren’t just about being able to paint, or play an instrument. They are about discipline, imagination, and being able to express the things you experience and feel.\\nAt UWC, we’ll encourage you to explore that creativity and channel what matters into art, dance, photography and music. We explore the culture and craft of our local areas, and give you the confidence to perform and play with others. This might involve taking to the stage for theatre or dance, learning about art history, visiting cultural sites, or performing for your school community and beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0- Saijai Liangpunsakul (Pearson College UWC, 2006-2008)\\n\\xa0\\nEvery UWC school draws from the community around it, and that applies to sport and activity as well.\\nOur students get the chance to play the sports they grew up loving, from football to basketball and tennis. But we also make full use of the environments around our schools, whether that means kayaking across beautiful lakes or hiking on snowy mountains.\\nWe believe that activity and exercise is a crucial part of our school experience. But it also gives us a chance to explore our surroundings, and truly experience the world around us.\\n\\n\\n- Luísa Gonçalves (UWC-USA, 2008-2010)\\nWe aim to make sure that every student realises that they can use their education to make a difference.\\nThat goes beyond the curriculum. It’s part of every day.\\nAt UWC, our classes encourage students to identify changes they can make in the world. It allows them to consider how they can act to improve lives, both as individuals, and together.\\nEvery year, we see students set up projects and initiatives that tackle issues head-on, from waste recycling to outreach and education. We see people leave with the confidence to stand up for what they believe in, and do something about it.\\nStudent initiatives can run as part of the school’s co-curricular service programme for other students and staff to join. In some cases students will have the chance to enter these projects into UWC-wide grant programmes such as Young Aurora, which allows students to enter a humanitarian project and win a USD 4,000 grant to further develop it, and Go Make A Difference, which grants up to USD 1,000 to UWC student projects each year. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - School Staff\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/collegestaff\\nHere are some of the staff members at our 18\\xa0UWC schools and colleges: remarkable teachers, passionate house parents, engaged heads of school, knowledgeable librarians, and many more (extra)ordinary people working every day to provide our students with the best possible UWC experience. Here are some of them.\\xa0\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - Pastoral Care\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/pastoralcare\\nJoining a school can be a big change. You’re part of a diverse group, often away from your home country, mastering a new language and a challenging curriculum.\\nAt UWC, we make sure that all of our students feel supported, inspired and welcomed in their school community.\\nEach UWC school has an on-site team that supports your well-being including but not limited to: house-parents, student advisors, peer support networks, nurses and counsellors, deans of students, health and wellness specialists, heads of residential life, psychologists and psychotherapists, and healthcare providers both on campus and locally.\\xa0\\n\\nWe also give students the tools to reflect on the part they play in their communities. We encourage them to think about how they treat others, and how they can help create a more respectful community, where everyone feels happy, safe and secure. During their induction,\\xa0students also receive training to help develop their cultural sensitivity, and be better community members.\\xa0\\nPastoral staff regularly meet to ensure they too are working towards creating a healthy community with common goals. They are also offered forums which enable pastoral staff across the UWC movement to collaborate and support each other.\\n\"The peer listeners are a group of students who have been invited to provide support to their peers. Any student can approach one of them and talk about their personal problems. The role of a peer listener is to help other students to explore what is going on in their lives and to identify signs and sources of stress, supporting them in sharing thoughts and emotions, referring them to other sources of help in the community when necessary or desirable. Research shows that peers are the first point of contact in times of distress, and that peer relationships can actually act as a buffer to stress. Feeling and experiencing that somebody is actually listening to us can be extremely helpful for our mental wellbeing. The peer listeners undergo training with the school psychologist participating in weekly sessions in which topics such as mental wellbeing and listening skills are explored.\"\\n- Gianmichele Laquale, Psychologist/Psychotherapist at UWC Dilijan\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - Code of Conduct\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/codeofconduct\\nAll UWC schools and colleges adhere to the “UWC Common Code of Conduct” originally put in place\\xa0by the UWC International Board in 2010 and revised in 2019.

The school assesses the nomination and decides whether to accept the student. The National Committee and school decisions are final.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAll students who are accepted for a place at a UWC will complete a financial assessment to determine how much financial support the school and NC will need to provide to enable the student to attend UWC.

UWC RBC has set aside three distinct scholarships for students from any country around the world. Each of these scholarships are focused on a specific theme of the college\\'s mission:\\n1. The French A Scholarship: UWC RBC is in Germany, near the border with France. Given the history of the region, the college is committed to maintaining a strong French language programme. A student on this scholarship would have a native or near-native level of French, and would commit to taking French A as their language option.\\xa0\\n2. The German B Scholarship: UWC RBC is a German school with a commitment to encouraging students to stay on in Germany for tertiary education. This scholarship is aimed at students who are second-language German speakers with a commitment to deepening their proficiency and then applying to German universities. We are looking for students with some prior exposure to German and a commitment to becoming fluent.\\xa0\\n3. The Sustainability Scholarship: UWC RBC is strongly committed to sustainability within its mission. A student nominated for the Sustainability Scholarship would provide evidence of their prior commitment to sustainability, and if successful, would commit to showing strong participation and leadership in the school\\'s sustainability programmes on campus.\\xa0\\nWe would strongly advise any prospective candidates for the UWC RBC Special Open Nomination to research UWC Robert Bosch in order to demonstrate their understanding of the concept for the specific programme that they are applying for.\\nAny candidate who has applied for one of the UWC RBC Special Open Nomination Scholarships and is not successful will be automatically entered into the general pool of candidates for the other UWC schools.\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - FAQs\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/how-to-apply/faqs\\nInternational travel has become very difficult because of Covid-19.

UWC achieves this through selection based on potential and merit and through the provision of scholarships.

We help students discover causes that matter to them, and learn how to turn them into initiatives, projects and activities that can help those around them for many years after they have left their UWC school and co-curricular activities behind.\\nThis means that, as a UWC student, you’ll build habits that aren’t just for school, but for life.\\nOur co-curricular activities vary by school, because it will be the specific surroundings of your UWC school that will determine the activities that are possible and the service initiatives that are needed.\\n\\n\\n- Ramila Patel, Head of Visual Arts, Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa\\nArt and creativity aren’t just about being able to paint, or play an instrument. They are about discipline, imagination, and being able to express the things you experience and feel.\\nAt UWC, we’ll encourage you to explore that creativity and channel what matters into art, dance, photography and music. We explore the culture and craft of our local areas, and give you the confidence to perform and play with others. This might involve taking to the stage for theatre or dance, learning about art history, visiting cultural sites, or performing for your school community and beyond.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0- Saijai Liangpunsakul (Pearson College UWC, 2006-2008)\\n\\xa0\\nEvery UWC school draws from the community around it, and that applies to sport and activity as well.\\nOur students get the chance to play the sports they grew up loving, from football to basketball and tennis. But we also make full use of the environments around our schools, whether that means kayaking across beautiful lakes or hiking on snowy mountains.\\nWe believe that activity and exercise is a crucial part of our school experience. But it also gives us a chance to explore our surroundings, and truly experience the world around us.\\n\\n\\n- Luísa Gonçalves (UWC-USA, 2008-2010)\\nWe aim to make sure that every student realises that they can use their education to make a difference.\\nThat goes beyond the curriculum. It’s part of every day.\\nAt UWC, our classes encourage students to identify changes they can make in the world. It allows them to consider how they can act to improve lives, both as individuals, and together.\\nEvery year, we see students set up projects and initiatives that tackle issues head-on, from waste recycling to outreach and education. We see people leave with the confidence to stand up for what they believe in, and do something about it.\\nStudent initiatives can run as part of the school’s co-curricular service programme for other students and staff to join. In some cases students will have the chance to enter these projects into UWC-wide grant programmes such as Young Aurora, which allows students to enter a humanitarian project and win a USD 4,000 grant to further develop it, and Go Make A Difference, which grants up to USD 1,000 to UWC student projects each year. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - Academic Life\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/page/?title=Academic Life&pid=3432\\nWe believe that everyone can play a role in making the world a better place, whichever path they choose.\\nSo we offer a challenging and broad education that will help you get the qualifications you need, to get the life you want for yourself and make the changes you want to see for others.\\nEvery year, students apply to UWC because they want a challenge that takes them out of their comfort zone. To open their minds to new perspectives, and discover new skills and talents.\\nIt’s a rigorous experience, but it’s one that could change how you see the world.\\nRead on to find out how you can take on this experience through either the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (16-19 year-olds), International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (16-19 year olds) or Younger Years programme (2-15 year-olds).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMost students attending UWC between the ages of 16 and 19 take the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), which is offered at all UWC schools and colleges. It’s a challenging curriculum that allows students to explore a range of subjects and ideas, while learning about the importance of activity and service in the community.\\nIn fact, UWC played a key role in crafting the IBDP back in the 1960s, and the ties between the IB Organisation and UWC remain close decades later.\\nThe IBDP aims to “encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.” It’s respected in the best universities worldwide for its focus on service, communication, teamwork, leadership and critical thinking.\\n\"Although the IBDP was quite overwhelming at times and there was a lot to be learned, overall it made me a lot more confident and taught me how to study. My first year at college felt much easier than my second year of IBDP. I’m much more sure of the things I say because I research them, and I’m so much better at writing.\"\\n- Leonor, UWC Mahindra College alumna\\nIBDP students choose a course from each of the following six subject areas:\\nStudents generally study three subjects at standard level and three subjects at a higher level. At a higher level they are expected to demonstrate a greater body of knowledge, understanding and skills. Subjects may vary between UWC schools, often reflecting their geographic location and focus areas.\\nAs well as the six subject areas, students complete three core parts of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme which are central to the philosophy of the programme. These are:\\nStudents investigate a topic of special interest, and develop the independent research and writing skills required at university level. The essay is typically written in one of the student’s six subject groups and must be no more than 4,000 words in length. Students are supported in the research and writing process by an academic supervisor.\\nThe course encourages students to reflect on the nature of knowledge, on how we know what we claim to know. It is assessed through an oral presentation and a 1,600-word essay.\\nTaking responsibility, developing social, creative and outdoor skills, as well as learning to approach others with empathy are at the heart of the programme. Students engage in a variety of projects that aim to help them develop these skills, while at the same time actively engaging with their local community.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAlongside the IBDP, some UWC schools and colleges also offer students aged 16 to 19 the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP).\\xa0\\nLike the IBDP, the IBCP is a rigorous educational programme that prepares students with the skills and knowledge to make a difference now and in their future, whatever they choose to do next. And just like the IBDP, it is a curriculum that is highly valued by universities worldwide.\\xa0\\nWhat makes the IBCP unique is that - unlike the IBDP - it offers students the opportunity to specialise in a specific field. If you have a desire to pursue a certain career or gain skills and hands-on experience in a particular area, this might be the right path for you.\\xa0\\nIBCP students undertake a minimum of two IBDP courses, a career-related study and an IBCP core:\\xa0\\nWithin the IBCP programme framework, Pearson College UWC\\xa0developed its unique two-year Climate Action Leadership Diploma (CALD), tailored to students with a passion for addressing climate change and environmental stewardship. Alongside taking two to three IBDP courses, CALD students embark on climate action leadership studies developed in conjunction with regional universities. The programme\\xa0incorporates place-based and Indigenous knowledge and environmental stewardship as well as bespoke programming, microcredentials and field school. CALD students are full members of the Pearson College UWC community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path.\\xa0\\nWithin the IBCP programme framework, UWC Maastricht has designed multiple pathways in partnership with reputable institutions:\\nIBCP students are full members of the UWC Maastricht community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path. IBCP students are also encouraged to further develop their talents through student-led initiatives, conferences, social entrepreneurship programmes, community services, outdoor learning, project weeks and music lessons.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA number of UWC schools and colleges welcome students from younger age groups, ranging from 2 to 15 years old. These younger years programmes run in addition to the IBDP that is offered at all UWC schools and colleges for learners aged 16-19.\\xa0\\nStudents in the younger years are immersed in age-appropriate educational programmes that align with UWC’s mission to make education a force for peace and a sustainable future.\\nAcademically, they are equipped for the rigours of the IBDP at UWC, should that be the path they follow later on their educational journey. But far beyond this, students from 2 to 15 learn to be active, aware contributors in their school, their local communities and in wider society through hands-on, values-driven and holistic learning programmes. They are emboldened to question, create and engage, and to develop strong social, emotional and creative skills for their lives beyond UWC.\\xa0\\nMost UWC schools with younger years provision have a mix of residential and non-residential students on campus. The age at which students can begin living on campus as boarding students depends on each school. This means that campus spaces are shared between those who attend classes but live with their families outside of campus and those who live in one of the residencies on campus. When it comes to those UWC schools that exclusively offer high school programmes for the 15-19 age range, all students live and learn together on campus as boarding students.\\xa0\\nUWC Changshu China welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. The school offers 15 year-olds the opportunity to enrol in a one-year long Foundation Programme in preparation for the IBDP (16-19 year-olds).\\xa0\\nUWC East Africa welcomes students between the ages of 3 and 20 on its two campuses, Arusha and Moshi. The school offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-11 year-olds, the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-20 year-olds. While Moshi Campus hosts both day students and boarding students for all three programmes, Arusha Campus accepts day students enrolled in the PYP and MYP, and both day students and boarding students in the IBDP years.\\xa0\\nUWC ISAK Japan welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. 15 year-old students can join the school as part of its 3-year high school programme, which emphasizes its flagship Leadership Programme in Grade 10, before merging with the 2-year IBDP in Grade 11 (16-19 year-olds).\\xa0\\xa0\\nUWC Maastricht welcomes students between the ages of 4 and 19. UWC Maastricht Primary School caters to 4-11 year-olds, while UWC Maastricht Secondary School offers the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP\\xa0and the IBCP\\xa0to 16-19 year-olds. The majority of UWC Maastricht\\'s students are day students and they live with their families in the region. Only IBDP and IBCP\\xa0students can live on campus as part of the residential programme, and most of them do.\\xa0\\nUWC South East Asia welcomes day and boarding students aged 4-18 years to two campuses, Dover and East. UWC South East Asia\\'s concept-based K-12 curriculum prepares students of all ages for their future by linking their learning in universal concepts to their real-world experiences in Singapore. New students can join the school at any grade in Primary (4-11 years), Middle (12-14 years) or High School (15-17 years), and can graduate with both a UWCSEA High School Diploma and an IB Diploma.\\nUWC Thailand welcomes students between 2 and 18 years of age. The Early Years Programme consists of play-based learning for the youngest students who are between 2 and 5 years old. The school also offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-12 year-olds, the IB Middle Year Programme (MYP)\\xa0to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-19 year-olds. The boarding programme at UWC Thailand is open to students in grades 9-12, which cover the last two years of MYP and the IBDP. Day students are eligible to enroll at all grade levels if they are full-time residents in Phuket.\\xa0\\nWaterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa welcomes day and boarding students between the ages of 11 and 19. Students aged 11-15 attend Lower Secondary School and follow the school’s own curriculum. Students aged 15-17 are offered the Cambridge IGCSE programme, and students aged 17-19 study the IBDP.\\xa0\\nPlease note that attending a UWC school during the younger years does not automatically grant students a place at UWC to study the IBDP later in life. All schools offering younger years programmes carefully monitor each individual student\\'s progress to ensure that the rigorous IBDP followed as part of the two-year programme for 16-19 year-olds is the right course of study for them.\\xa0\\nPlease contact the school of your choice for more information about younger years provision.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTitle: UWC Zimbabwe - What is UWC?\\n Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/page/?title=What is UWC?&pid=3417\\n You have not allowed cookies and this content may contain cookies.

While students do not spend an equal amount of time on each of the elements (for much of the year, the academic element takes up most of the day), equal value is placed on them.\\xa0\\nThe programme strives to give each student age-appropriate opportunities to develop qualities and skills, and the concept-based K-12 curriculum is common across both campuses. Students are led through age-appropriate learning across each academic discipline, with the intent to develop knowledge that will support successful study in the IB Diploma in Grade 11 and 12, and beyond.\\xa0\\nAn extensive Home Languages Programme supports multilingual students of all ages who are speakers of languages other than English to maintain their home language. It’s aim is to create opportunities for students to maintain and develop both academic and communicative language skills should the student wish to join the bespoke UWCSEA First Language Programme offered in the Grade 9 and 10 academic programme in preparation for study of the language in the IBDP.UWCSEA’s High Schools offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) for Grade 11 and 12. Students joining the College in Grade 9 complete a two-year programme, while a Foundation IB course is offered to students joining in Grade 10. Alongside standard courses, UWCSEA offers Dutch, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and Russian language options, and Design Technology, Computer Science, Environmental Systems and Societies, Global Politics, Psychology, Philosophy, Sports Exercise and Health Science, Dance, Film, Music, Visual Arts and Theatre.\\nUWCSEA’s learning environment has been crafted to support well-being and therefore effective learning, with a focus on ensuring each student feels valued, cared for, secure and supported. The aim is to help students develop strong social and emotional skills so they are better equipped to manage themselves, relate to others, develop resilience and a sense of self-worth, resolve conflict, engage in teamwork and feel positive about themselves and the world around them.\\nStudents are regularly given opportunities to observe and investigate the natural world around them while safely challenging their own capabilities, both independently and in collaboration with others. For all grades, this includes exploring the campus gardens and other natural spaces as part of the school day.\\nAll students are engaged in age-appropriate, service learning activities, linked directly to our K–12 curriculum, as well as to other elements of our UWCSEA learning programme. While the service interactions across our campuses are different, regardless of campus, school, grade or classroom, all students are striving in each of the three areas of learning identified in our service curriculum:\\nDeveloping compassion and responsibility, the Service programme allows students to put UWC values into action as they engage in rewarding experiential learning opportunities guided by the service learning curriculum.\\nAt the very heart of the UWC mission, service enables students to actively contribute to resolving social and environmental problems, both locally and globally. As students deepen their understanding of why these problems exist, they are guided to realise that everyone can play a part in taking informed, purposeful action to resolve them.\\nBoth within and beyond the campuses, all students also take on experiential challenges that build resilience, collaboration and leadership through a carefully planned incremental progression of age-appropriate Outdoor Education experiences.\\xa0\\nOpportunities for learning are then extended as students take on experiential challenges that build resilience, collaboration and leadership. Whether exploring the natural environment on campus in K1, learning about water filtration in Grade 3 or taking on our High Ropes course in Grade 8, students develop confidence in their physical abilities and the emotional resilience to withstand difficult situations.\\nAchievements in outdoor education are recorded through student reflections and demonstrated in the character, skills, qualities and maturity that students develop and apply across all aspects of the learning programme and in their lives. UWCSEA is partnering with Oregon State University-Cascades to conduct a longitudinal study into the impacts of outdoor education. Interim findings present compelling evidence in support of the long-term benefits for students of an intentional Outdoor Education programme.\\nAnother vital part of student life and learning, the multifaceted Activities programme provides students with opportunities to explore new interests, develop their strengths and pursue their passions. They can do this through existing activities, or by finding students and staff who will join them in starting a new one as they make like-minded friends and interact with students from other grades and parts of the school.\\nThe Initiative for Peace (IfP) was founded in 2001\\xa0to promote peace in global, national and regional conflicts. The annual conferences are hosted by Grade 11 students following\\xa0a year of preparation. Students from both campuses receive training from specialists in the fields of public administration, conflict resolution and negotiation, and historical perspectives in order to facilitate events for youth leaders from the host country.\\nUWCSEA has made an IfP toolkit available for educators and other youth leadership organisations who wish to replicate and adapt the programme in their own context and communities.\\xa0\\nBoth campuses offer exceptional facilities suited to the hands-on and technologically integrated learning programme. From classrooms, resource centres and libraries equipped with state-of-the-art technology and tools, to professionally equipped performance spaces, to outstanding sporting facilities, the environment has been designed to support all five elements of the UWCSEA learning programme.\\nWhether purpose built, as in the East Campus, or having reimagined existing infrastructure on the site of the former St. John’s Army School in the case of Dover Campus, both locations have shared learning spaces that help to create a community. Age-appropriate facilities allow all students multiple opportunities to access authentic learning experiences in their immediate environment.\\nThe GreenMark Platinum Super Low Energy certification held by both campuses means they have achieved the highest ‘green building’ standard in Singapore, and continue to operate within benchmarks set to contribute to Singapore’s ambitious sustainability goals. Environmental and design aspects of the buildings are integrated into the learning programme wherever possible, helping to bring to life both systems thinking for students and the College’s sustainability agenda to develop students as environmental stewards.\\nDover Campus was established in the existing St John’s Army School in 1971, and features many mature trees and plenty of open spaces. While the campus has transformed over a multi-year refurbishment project, the Tent Plaza remains the social heart of the campus. There are three boarding houses, Kurt Hahn House,\\xa0Nelson Mandela House and Malala Yousafzai House,\\xa0\\xa0which host over 190 boarders in Grades 8 to 12.\\nOpened in August 2011, the East Campus is a purpose-built facility that, in keeping with UWC’s sustainability goal, continues to set global benchmarks in design, innovation, accessibility and environmental impact for schools. Tampines House, a multi-story boarding house that overlooks the campus, hosts about 160 students in Grades 8 to 12.\\nDover Campus occupies 11 hectares in Clementi, west of the central business district and next to the National University of Singapore. The East Campus is set on 5.5 hectares in Tampines, a fast-developing northeastern hub near Changi Airport.\\nMost students are admitted directly, taking into account the UWC mission by deliberately recruiting students who are committed to the mission and vision of the School from a diverse array of backgrounds, nationalities and life experiences. Scholarship students are in most cases selected via the UWC national committee system. Most of them join for the two-year IBDP, however, a smaller number of students join on 5 or 3-year scholarships (in Grade 8 or Grade 10) to be granted appropriate preparation for the IBDP.
