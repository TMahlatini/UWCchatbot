Title: UWC Zimbabwe - UWC Educational Model and Principles
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/educationalmodel
“There is more in us than we know if we could be made to see it; perhaps, for the rest of our lives we will be unwilling to settle for less.”
Kurt Hahn, Founder of UWC
We believe that education should help young people discover that change is possible, and that they can make it happen.
As a UWC student, you’ll learn how you can inspire change through courageous action, selfless leadership, and careful listening. You’ll take part in experiences and community activities, so that you’re prepared to build with confidence and lead with compassion in later life. 

We’ve built our educational model on a set of principles that aim to help you reach your potential - academically, morally, socially and emotionally. Our schools each have their own distinct identity, but they’re united by these common values:
We’ve built our approach and curriculum on these principles, and have inspired thousands to find the skills and confidence to spark change.
After UWC, you’ll be able to progress to your chosen university, or to the calling that suits you. 
You’ll leave here with a strong academic foundation. But also a stronger understanding of yourself, the world around you, and the power to help others.
It’s an education, built differently.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - UWC History & Founding Ideas
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/history
This idea has been at the heart of what we do at UWC, ever since our first school was founded in 1962.
We believe that education can be about more than just personal advancement, or securing a place at university. It can inspire students to discover what connects us all as humans, and to act as champions for a world of peace, collaboration and understanding.
"I regard it as the foremost task of education to ensure the survival of these qualities: an enterprising curiosity, an undefeatable spirit, tenacity in pursuit, readiness for sensible self-denial, and - above all - compassion."
- Kurt Hahn (Founder of UWC)
In 1955, educational pioneer Kurt Hahn delivered a speech at the NATO Defense College in Paris. During his visit, he was inspired by the cooperation and loyalty shown by military men who had very recently been on opposite sides in World War Two.
Hahn had already been involved in the founding of a number of schools and education organisations, and his ideas on education were constantly evolving. At the time, he talked frequently about the power of education as a route to peace, as well as a need to reverse the “decline of compassion” in society.
It was through the convergence of these ideas that UWC was eventually born. 
In a 1958 speech, he said:
In 1962, UWC Atlantic (originally called Atlantic College) in Wales, United Kingdom, admitted its first students. The first UWC school was built on the idea that if young people from different backgrounds were educated together, they could build an understanding which could prevent future conflicts.
It was the world’s first international, two-year Sixth Form College for teenagers aged 16 to 19.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It was a place where they would learn the empathy that enabled them to listen, and consider other perspectives, even if they were very different to their own. They would learn the strength to stand for what was right, even if the risk was great. And they would learn to be resilient, and to learn from mistakes rather than give up.
From the earliest days of Atlantic College, there was a desire to replicate the model. It was the height of the Cold War, and many saw the benefits of an idea that valued connection, compassion and service. By the end of the 1960s, the United World Colleges name had been coined, and a movement started to become a reality.
UWC’s first international president, Lord Mountbatten, helped the UWC movement develop beyond its North Atlantic roots. He oversaw the foundation of national committees, which would select students and promote UWC in different countries. In years to come, UWC schools would appear in Singapore and Canada, and later in continents across the world.
UWC has always been about listening, and learning. It has evolved and grown in line with the needs of its communities and the world around it. And its commitment to peace, understanding and resilience remains as strong as ever. 
There are 18 UWC schools and colleges.
We are represented in more than 150 countries through our national committees.
Over 60,000 students from over 180 countries have studied at UWC schools and colleges and on our short course programmes.

UWC’s 18 schools and colleges are set on 4 continents and deliver a challenging and transformational education to over 10,500 students each year. 
Each of our schools and colleges has its own distinct character and identity, influenced by their host country, the specific setting, cultural context and their community. Some campuses are nestled in nature, while others are integrated into towns or cities. These surroundings also help shape what makes each UWC school or college experience special. In some cases, it's their proximity to the ocean or a rainforest that adds an experiential element to learning about sustainability, for example. In others, it’s the history of the local area which can help inform students’ understanding of how to build a better tomorrow. 
What makes each one of them a UWC is their deliberately diverse student body and their commitment to the UWC mission of making education a force for peace and sustainability. At each UWC, students come together from all over the world, and from very different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, to live and learn with each other and from each other what change is needed in the world, and how they can make it happen.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Life at UWC
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/page/?title=UWC+Experience&pid=3430
Idai Chelsea Makoni (UWC Mahindra, India, 2015-2017)
"My life will never be the same after going to UWC. I have learned how to think critically. The opportunity I had to meet different people from different backgrounds changed the way I view the world. The faculty, in particular, played a huge role in shaping my UWC experience, as they were extremely passionate and used alternative methods of teaching. I left UWC with a strong Pan-Africanist identity and I hope to work in development, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa."
 
Munashe Machoko (UWC Changshu, China, 2015-2017)
"I really cannot explain how much UWC has changed the way I think and the way I perceive life. It happens every day, it’s not a one-time thing: you learn something new about the world, your community and yourself through every activity you do at a UWC. It's not something you can explain, it's something you have to experience."

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Academic Life
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/academiclife
We believe that everyone can play a role in making the world a better place, whichever path they choose.
So we offer a challenging and broad education that will help you get the qualifications you need, to get the life you want for yourself and make the changes you want to see for others.
Every year, students apply to UWC because they want a challenge that takes them out of their comfort zone. To open their minds to new perspectives, and discover new skills and talents.
It’s a rigorous experience, but it’s one that could change how you see the world.
Read on to find out how you can take on this experience through either the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (16-19 year-olds), International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (16-19 year olds) or Younger Years programme (2-15 year-olds). 


Most students attending UWC between the ages of 16 and 19 take the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), which is offered at all UWC schools and colleges. It’s a challenging curriculum that allows students to explore a range of subjects and ideas, while learning about the importance of activity and service in the community.
In fact, UWC played a key role in crafting the IBDP back in the 1960s, and the ties between the IB Organisation and UWC remain close decades later.
The IBDP aims to “encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.” It’s respected in the best universities worldwide for its focus on service, communication, teamwork, leadership and critical thinking.
"Although the IBDP was quite overwhelming at times and there was a lot to be learned, overall it made me a lot more confident and taught me how to study. My first year at college felt much easier than my second year of IBDP. I’m much more sure of the things I say because I research them, and I’m so much better at writing."
- Leonor, UWC Mahindra College alumna
IBDP students choose a course from each of the following six subject areas:
Students generally study three subjects at standard level and three subjects at a higher level. At a higher level they are expected to demonstrate a greater body of knowledge, understanding and skills. Subjects may vary between UWC schools, often reflecting their geographic location and focus areas.
As well as the six subject areas, students complete three core parts of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme which are central to the philosophy of the programme. These are:
Students investigate a topic of special interest, and develop the independent research and writing skills required at university level. The essay is typically written in one of the student’s six subject groups and must be no more than 4,000 words in length. Students are supported in the research and writing process by an academic supervisor.
The course encourages students to reflect on the nature of knowledge, on how we know what we claim to know. It is assessed through an oral presentation and a 1,600-word essay.
Taking responsibility, developing social, creative and outdoor skills, as well as learning to approach others with empathy are at the heart of the programme. Students engage in a variety of projects that aim to help them develop these skills, while at the same time actively engaging with their local community.
 
 


Alongside the IBDP, some UWC schools and colleges also offer students aged 16 to 19 the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP). 
Like the IBDP, the IBCP is a rigorous educational programme that prepares students with the skills and knowledge to make a difference now and in their future, whatever they choose to do next. And just like the IBDP, it is a curriculum that is highly valued by universities worldwide. 
What makes the IBCP unique is that - unlike the IBDP - it offers students the opportunity to specialise in a specific field. If you have a desire to pursue a certain career or gain skills and hands-on experience in a particular area, this might be the right path for you. 
IBCP students undertake a minimum of two IBDP courses, a career-related study and an IBCP core: 
Within the IBCP programme framework, Pearson College UWC developed its unique two-year Climate Action Leadership Diploma (CALD), tailored to students with a passion for addressing climate change and environmental stewardship. Alongside taking two to three IBDP courses, CALD students embark on climate action leadership studies developed in conjunction with regional universities. The programme incorporates place-based and Indigenous knowledge and environmental stewardship as well as bespoke programming, microcredentials and field school. CALD students are full members of the Pearson College UWC community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path. 
Within the IBCP programme framework, UWC Maastricht has designed multiple pathways in partnership with reputable institutions:
IBCP students are full members of the UWC Maastricht community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path. IBCP students are also encouraged to further develop their talents through student-led initiatives, conferences, social entrepreneurship programmes, community services, outdoor learning, project weeks and music lessons.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A number of UWC schools and colleges welcome students from younger age groups, ranging from 2 to 15 years old. These younger years programmes run in addition to the IBDP that is offered at all UWC schools and colleges for learners aged 16-19. 
Students in the younger years are immersed in age-appropriate educational programmes that align with UWC’s mission to make education a force for peace and a sustainable future.
Academically, they are equipped for the rigours of the IBDP at UWC, should that be the path they follow later on their educational journey. But far beyond this, students from 2 to 15 learn to be active, aware contributors in their school, their local communities and in wider society through hands-on, values-driven and holistic learning programmes. They are emboldened to question, create and engage, and to develop strong social, emotional and creative skills for their lives beyond UWC. 
Most UWC schools with younger years provision have a mix of residential and non-residential students on campus. The age at which students can begin living on campus as boarding students depends on each school. This means that campus spaces are shared between those who attend classes but live with their families outside of campus and those who live in one of the residencies on campus. When it comes to those UWC schools that exclusively offer high school programmes for the 15-19 age range, all students live and learn together on campus as boarding students. 
UWC Changshu China welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. The school offers 15 year-olds the opportunity to enrol in a one-year long Foundation Programme in preparation for the IBDP (16-19 year-olds). 
UWC East Africa welcomes students between the ages of 3 and 20 on its two campuses, Arusha and Moshi. The school offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-11 year-olds, the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-20 year-olds. While Moshi Campus hosts both day students and boarding students for all three programmes, Arusha Campus accepts day students enrolled in the PYP and MYP, and both day students and boarding students in the IBDP years. 
UWC ISAK Japan welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. 15 year-old students can join the school as part of its 3-year high school programme, which emphasizes its flagship Leadership Programme in Grade 10, before merging with the 2-year IBDP in Grade 11 (16-19 year-olds).  
UWC Maastricht welcomes students between the ages of 4 and 19. UWC Maastricht Primary School caters to 4-11 year-olds, while UWC Maastricht Secondary School offers the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP and the IBCP to 16-19 year-olds. The majority of UWC Maastricht's students are day students and they live with their families in the region. Only IBDP and IBCP students can live on campus as part of the residential programme, and most of them do. 
UWC South East Asia welcomes day and boarding students aged 4-18 years to two campuses, Dover and East. UWC South East Asia's concept-based K-12 curriculum prepares students of all ages for their future by linking their learning in universal concepts to their real-world experiences in Singapore. New students can join the school at any grade in Primary (4-11 years), Middle (12-14 years) or High School (15-17 years), and can graduate with both a UWCSEA High School Diploma and an IB Diploma.
UWC Thailand welcomes students between 2 and 18 years of age. The Early Years Programme consists of play-based learning for the youngest students who are between 2 and 5 years old. The school also offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-12 year-olds, the IB Middle Year Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-19 year-olds. The boarding programme at UWC Thailand is open to students in grades 9-12, which cover the last two years of MYP and the IBDP. Day students are eligible to enroll at all grade levels if they are full-time residents in Phuket. 
Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa welcomes day and boarding students between the ages of 11 and 19. Students aged 11-15 attend Lower Secondary School and follow the school’s own curriculum. Students aged 15-17 are offered the Cambridge IGCSE programme, and students aged 17-19 study the IBDP. 
Please note that attending a UWC school during the younger years does not automatically grant students a place at UWC to study the IBDP later in life. All schools offering younger years programmes carefully monitor each individual student's progress to ensure that the rigorous IBDP followed as part of the two-year programme for 16-19 year-olds is the right course of study for them. 
Please contact the school of your choice for more information about younger years provision. 
 
 

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/cocurricular
“We’re giving students a formative experience by putting them on a journey of discovery. My 17-year-old self had no clue who I was. The greatest gift we’re giving them is an understanding of their place in the world, and an opportunity to realise their own visions.” 
- Christian Bock, Academic Director & IB Coordinator, UWC Robert Bosch College, Germany
Many schools worldwide now study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, a curriculum that promotes creativity, activity and service.
But we take its principles further.
Our diverse school communities encourage students to explore different perspectives with their fellow classmates, rather than just learning them from books.
We explore the art and culture of our surroundings first-hand, and consider how creativity and imagination can help us understand and change the world.
And our focus on community service goes far beyond fulfilling the IBDP requirements or boosting students' university applications. We help students discover causes that matter to them, and learn how to turn them into initiatives, projects and activities that can help those around them for many years after they have left their UWC school and co-curricular activities behind.
This means that, as a UWC student, you’ll build habits that aren’t just for school, but for life.
Our co-curricular activities vary by school, because it will be the specific surroundings of your UWC school that will determine the activities that are possible and the service initiatives that are needed.


- Ramila Patel, Head of Visual Arts, Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa
Art and creativity aren’t just about being able to paint, or play an instrument. They are about discipline, imagination, and being able to express the things you experience and feel.
At UWC, we’ll encourage you to explore that creativity and channel what matters into art, dance, photography and music. We explore the culture and craft of our local areas, and give you the confidence to perform and play with others. This might involve taking to the stage for theatre or dance, learning about art history, visiting cultural sites, or performing for your school community and beyond.


 - Saijai Liangpunsakul (Pearson College UWC, 2006-2008)
 
Every UWC school draws from the community around it, and that applies to sport and activity as well.
Our students get the chance to play the sports they grew up loving, from football to basketball and tennis. But we also make full use of the environments around our schools, whether that means kayaking across beautiful lakes or hiking on snowy mountains.
We believe that activity and exercise is a crucial part of our school experience. But it also gives us a chance to explore our surroundings, and truly experience the world around us.


- Luísa Gonçalves (UWC-USA, 2008-2010)
We aim to make sure that every student realises that they can use their education to make a difference.
That goes beyond the curriculum. It’s part of every day.
At UWC, our classes encourage students to identify changes they can make in the world. It allows them to consider how they can act to improve lives, both as individuals, and together.
Every year, we see students set up projects and initiatives that tackle issues head-on, from waste recycling to outreach and education. We see people leave with the confidence to stand up for what they believe in, and do something about it.
Student initiatives can run as part of the school’s co-curricular service programme for other students and staff to join. In some cases students will have the chance to enter these projects into UWC-wide grant programmes such as Young Aurora, which allows students to enter a humanitarian project and win a USD 4,000 grant to further develop it, and Go Make A Difference, which grants up to USD 1,000 to UWC student projects each year.

Here are some of them. 

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Pastoral Care
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/pastoralcare
Joining a school can be a big change. You’re part of a diverse group, often away from your home country, mastering a new language and a challenging curriculum.
At UWC, we make sure that all of our students feel supported, inspired and welcomed in their school community.
Each UWC school has an on-site team that supports your well-being including but not limited to: house-parents, student advisors, peer support networks, nurses and counsellors, deans of students, health and wellness specialists, heads of residential life, psychologists and psychotherapists, and healthcare providers both on campus and locally. 

We also give students the tools to reflect on the part they play in their communities. We encourage them to think about how they treat others, and how they can help create a more respectful community, where everyone feels happy, safe and secure. During their induction, students also receive training to help develop their cultural sensitivity, and be better community members. 
Pastoral staff regularly meet to ensure they too are working towards creating a healthy community with common goals. They are also offered forums which enable pastoral staff across the UWC movement to collaborate and support each other.
"The peer listeners are a group of students who have been invited to provide support to their peers. Any student can approach one of them and talk about their personal problems. The role of a peer listener is to help other students to explore what is going on in their lives and to identify signs and sources of stress, supporting them in sharing thoughts and emotions, referring them to other sources of help in the community when necessary or desirable. Research shows that peers are the first point of contact in times of distress, and that peer relationships can actually act as a buffer to stress. Feeling and experiencing that somebody is actually listening to us can be extremely helpful for our mental wellbeing. The peer listeners undergo training with the school psychologist participating in weekly sessions in which topics such as mental wellbeing and listening skills are explored."
- Gianmichele Laquale, Psychologist/Psychotherapist at UWC Dilijan

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Code of Conduct
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/codeofconduct
All UWC schools and colleges adhere to the “UWC Common Code of Conduct” originally put in place by the UWC International Board in 2010 and revised in 2019. This common set of values and guidelines recognises that all of our students should have a safe, fulfilling, and culturally sensitive experience on campus. The expectation of our entire community is that the UWC Common Code of Conduct will be followed both in action and in spirit.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Available Opportunities
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/how-to-apply/available-opportunities
UWC Zimbabwe typically receives offers for places from 4-8 UWC schools. These UWCs vary from year to year. Each school has a special character and focus, but all the schools are strongly rooted in the UWC ideals and traditions. Candidates do not choose their school, the National Committee matches the selected students to the school that will both challenge and support them best and then nominates the students to the school. The school assesses the nomination and decides whether to accept the student. The National Committee and school decisions are final. 
 
All students who are accepted for a place at a UWC will complete a financial assessment to determine how much financial support the school and NC will need to provide to enable the student to attend UWC. No students will be turned down because of lack of financial support. 
In 2024, the Zimbabwe National Committee will be selecting students to nominate to the following schools: 
In addition to these places, which are reserved for Zimbabwean nominations, we also have the opportunity to send in nominations for a Special Open Nomination at UWC Robert Bosch College in Germany. UWC RBC has set aside three distinct scholarships for students from any country around the world. Each of these scholarships are focused on a specific theme of the college's mission:
1. The French A Scholarship: UWC RBC is in Germany, near the border with France. Given the history of the region, the college is committed to maintaining a strong French language programme. A student on this scholarship would have a native or near-native level of French, and would commit to taking French A as their language option. 
2. The German B Scholarship: UWC RBC is a German school with a commitment to encouraging students to stay on in Germany for tertiary education. This scholarship is aimed at students who are second-language German speakers with a commitment to deepening their proficiency and then applying to German universities. We are looking for students with some prior exposure to German and a commitment to becoming fluent. 
3. The Sustainability Scholarship: UWC RBC is strongly committed to sustainability within its mission. A student nominated for the Sustainability Scholarship would provide evidence of their prior commitment to sustainability, and if successful, would commit to showing strong participation and leadership in the school's sustainability programmes on campus. 
We would strongly advise any prospective candidates for the UWC RBC Special Open Nomination to research UWC Robert Bosch in order to demonstrate their understanding of the concept for the specific programme that they are applying for.
Any candidate who has applied for one of the UWC RBC Special Open Nomination Scholarships and is not successful will be automatically entered into the general pool of candidates for the other UWC schools.

UWC is committed to ensuring that as many students as possible have the opportunity to experience a UWC education regardless of national, socioeconomic, cultural, racial or religious background. UWC achieves this through selection based on potential and merit and through the provision of scholarships. To continue this work, UWC relies on donations from alumni and other individuals, trusts, foundations, companies and governments.
A donation to UWC Zimbabwe will help provide educational opportunities to the youth of Zimbabwe. Your donation will be used in one of three ways: fund a scholarship, help pay for student costs or help fund our operations.
Scholarships - UWC schools and colleges offer scholarships to the national committee system each year, but by donating directly to the national committee you can help fund additional UWC scholarships and provide more opportunities for the youth of Zimbabwe.
Additional Costs - A scholarship provided by a UWC school or college covers the student's tuition, but there are other costs associated with attending a UWC. The cost of visas, international flights and extra-curricular activities are vital to the student's educational journey but are often unaffordable for those most in need. Your donation will help ensure that we are able to reach out and provide opportunities to even the poorest sections of society.
National committee operational costs - UWC Zimbabwe is run by dedicated volunteers who do not receive any payment. However, the national committee needs funds in order to operate. Your donation will help fund the promotion and selection process, and will be used towards costs such as: promoting UWC in the media, reaching out to vulnerable communities who would not otherwise hear of the opportunity and providing a suitable location for the selection of students.
You can donate to UWC Zimbabwe via UWC International and the funds and the details of your donations will be transferred to the National Committee. Please indicate that you would like to make your donation to "UWC Zimbabwe" using the drop-down menu. Hope this is OK with you.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/page/?title=Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)&pid=3433
“We’re giving students a formative experience by putting them on a journey of discovery. My 17-year-old self had no clue who I was. The greatest gift we’re giving them is an understanding of their place in the world, and an opportunity to realise their own visions.” 
- Christian Bock, Academic Director & IB Coordinator, UWC Robert Bosch College, Germany
Many schools worldwide now study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, a curriculum that promotes creativity, activity and service.
But we take its principles further.
Our diverse school communities encourage students to explore different perspectives with their fellow classmates, rather than just learning them from books.
We explore the art and culture of our surroundings first-hand, and consider how creativity and imagination can help us understand and change the world.
And our focus on community service goes far beyond fulfilling the IBDP requirements or boosting students' university applications. We help students discover causes that matter to them, and learn how to turn them into initiatives, projects and activities that can help those around them for many years after they have left their UWC school and co-curricular activities behind.
This means that, as a UWC student, you’ll build habits that aren’t just for school, but for life.
Our co-curricular activities vary by school, because it will be the specific surroundings of your UWC school that will determine the activities that are possible and the service initiatives that are needed.


- Ramila Patel, Head of Visual Arts, Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa
Art and creativity aren’t just about being able to paint, or play an instrument. They are about discipline, imagination, and being able to express the things you experience and feel.
At UWC, we’ll encourage you to explore that creativity and channel what matters into art, dance, photography and music. We explore the culture and craft of our local areas, and give you the confidence to perform and play with others. This might involve taking to the stage for theatre or dance, learning about art history, visiting cultural sites, or performing for your school community and beyond.


 - Saijai Liangpunsakul (Pearson College UWC, 2006-2008)
 
Every UWC school draws from the community around it, and that applies to sport and activity as well.
Our students get the chance to play the sports they grew up loving, from football to basketball and tennis. But we also make full use of the environments around our schools, whether that means kayaking across beautiful lakes or hiking on snowy mountains.
We believe that activity and exercise is a crucial part of our school experience. But it also gives us a chance to explore our surroundings, and truly experience the world around us.


- Luísa Gonçalves (UWC-USA, 2008-2010)
We aim to make sure that every student realises that they can use their education to make a difference.
That goes beyond the curriculum. It’s part of every day.
At UWC, our classes encourage students to identify changes they can make in the world. It allows them to consider how they can act to improve lives, both as individuals, and together.
Every year, we see students set up projects and initiatives that tackle issues head-on, from waste recycling to outreach and education. We see people leave with the confidence to stand up for what they believe in, and do something about it.
Student initiatives can run as part of the school’s co-curricular service programme for other students and staff to join. In some cases students will have the chance to enter these projects into UWC-wide grant programmes such as Young Aurora, which allows students to enter a humanitarian project and win a USD 4,000 grant to further develop it, and Go Make A Difference, which grants up to USD 1,000 to UWC student projects each year.  
 
 

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - Academic Life
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/page/?title=Academic Life&pid=3432
We believe that everyone can play a role in making the world a better place, whichever path they choose.
So we offer a challenging and broad education that will help you get the qualifications you need, to get the life you want for yourself and make the changes you want to see for others.
Every year, students apply to UWC because they want a challenge that takes them out of their comfort zone. To open their minds to new perspectives, and discover new skills and talents.
It’s a rigorous experience, but it’s one that could change how you see the world.
Read on to find out how you can take on this experience through either the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (16-19 year-olds), International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (16-19 year olds) or Younger Years programme (2-15 year-olds). 


Most students attending UWC between the ages of 16 and 19 take the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), which is offered at all UWC schools and colleges. It’s a challenging curriculum that allows students to explore a range of subjects and ideas, while learning about the importance of activity and service in the community.
In fact, UWC played a key role in crafting the IBDP back in the 1960s, and the ties between the IB Organisation and UWC remain close decades later.
The IBDP aims to “encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.” It’s respected in the best universities worldwide for its focus on service, communication, teamwork, leadership and critical thinking.
"Although the IBDP was quite overwhelming at times and there was a lot to be learned, overall it made me a lot more confident and taught me how to study. My first year at college felt much easier than my second year of IBDP. I’m much more sure of the things I say because I research them, and I’m so much better at writing."
- Leonor, UWC Mahindra College alumna
IBDP students choose a course from each of the following six subject areas:
Students generally study three subjects at standard level and three subjects at a higher level. At a higher level they are expected to demonstrate a greater body of knowledge, understanding and skills. Subjects may vary between UWC schools, often reflecting their geographic location and focus areas.
As well as the six subject areas, students complete three core parts of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme which are central to the philosophy of the programme. These are:
Students investigate a topic of special interest, and develop the independent research and writing skills required at university level. The essay is typically written in one of the student’s six subject groups and must be no more than 4,000 words in length. Students are supported in the research and writing process by an academic supervisor.
The course encourages students to reflect on the nature of knowledge, on how we know what we claim to know. It is assessed through an oral presentation and a 1,600-word essay.
Taking responsibility, developing social, creative and outdoor skills, as well as learning to approach others with empathy are at the heart of the programme. Students engage in a variety of projects that aim to help them develop these skills, while at the same time actively engaging with their local community.
 
 


Alongside the IBDP, some UWC schools and colleges also offer students aged 16 to 19 the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP). 
Like the IBDP, the IBCP is a rigorous educational programme that prepares students with the skills and knowledge to make a difference now and in their future, whatever they choose to do next. And just like the IBDP, it is a curriculum that is highly valued by universities worldwide. 
What makes the IBCP unique is that - unlike the IBDP - it offers students the opportunity to specialise in a specific field. If you have a desire to pursue a certain career or gain skills and hands-on experience in a particular area, this might be the right path for you. 
IBCP students undertake a minimum of two IBDP courses, a career-related study and an IBCP core: 
Within the IBCP programme framework, Pearson College UWC developed its unique two-year Climate Action Leadership Diploma (CALD), tailored to students with a passion for addressing climate change and environmental stewardship. Alongside taking two to three IBDP courses, CALD students embark on climate action leadership studies developed in conjunction with regional universities. The programme incorporates place-based and Indigenous knowledge and environmental stewardship as well as bespoke programming, microcredentials and field school. CALD students are full members of the Pearson College UWC community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path. 
Within the IBCP programme framework, UWC Maastricht has designed multiple pathways in partnership with reputable institutions:
IBCP students are full members of the UWC Maastricht community, participating in all areas of UWC experience alongside their IBDP peers, while following a parallel academic path. IBCP students are also encouraged to further develop their talents through student-led initiatives, conferences, social entrepreneurship programmes, community services, outdoor learning, project weeks and music lessons.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A number of UWC schools and colleges welcome students from younger age groups, ranging from 2 to 15 years old. These younger years programmes run in addition to the IBDP that is offered at all UWC schools and colleges for learners aged 16-19. 
Students in the younger years are immersed in age-appropriate educational programmes that align with UWC’s mission to make education a force for peace and a sustainable future.
Academically, they are equipped for the rigours of the IBDP at UWC, should that be the path they follow later on their educational journey. But far beyond this, students from 2 to 15 learn to be active, aware contributors in their school, their local communities and in wider society through hands-on, values-driven and holistic learning programmes. They are emboldened to question, create and engage, and to develop strong social, emotional and creative skills for their lives beyond UWC. 
Most UWC schools with younger years provision have a mix of residential and non-residential students on campus. The age at which students can begin living on campus as boarding students depends on each school. This means that campus spaces are shared between those who attend classes but live with their families outside of campus and those who live in one of the residencies on campus. When it comes to those UWC schools that exclusively offer high school programmes for the 15-19 age range, all students live and learn together on campus as boarding students. 
UWC Changshu China welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. The school offers 15 year-olds the opportunity to enrol in a one-year long Foundation Programme in preparation for the IBDP (16-19 year-olds). 
UWC East Africa welcomes students between the ages of 3 and 20 on its two campuses, Arusha and Moshi. The school offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-11 year-olds, the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-20 year-olds. While Moshi Campus hosts both day students and boarding students for all three programmes, Arusha Campus accepts day students enrolled in the PYP and MYP, and both day students and boarding students in the IBDP years. 
UWC ISAK Japan welcomes boarding students between the ages of 15 and 19. 15 year-old students can join the school as part of its 3-year high school programme, which emphasizes its flagship Leadership Programme in Grade 10, before merging with the 2-year IBDP in Grade 11 (16-19 year-olds).  
UWC Maastricht welcomes students between the ages of 4 and 19. UWC Maastricht Primary School caters to 4-11 year-olds, while UWC Maastricht Secondary School offers the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP and the IBCP to 16-19 year-olds. The majority of UWC Maastricht's students are day students and they live with their families in the region. Only IBDP and IBCP students can live on campus as part of the residential programme, and most of them do. 
UWC South East Asia welcomes day and boarding students aged 4-18 years to two campuses, Dover and East. UWC South East Asia's concept-based K-12 curriculum prepares students of all ages for their future by linking their learning in universal concepts to their real-world experiences in Singapore. New students can join the school at any grade in Primary (4-11 years), Middle (12-14 years) or High School (15-17 years), and can graduate with both a UWCSEA High School Diploma and an IB Diploma.
UWC Thailand welcomes students between 2 and 18 years of age. The Early Years Programme consists of play-based learning for the youngest students who are between 2 and 5 years old. The school also offers the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) to 3-12 year-olds, the IB Middle Year Programme (MYP) to 11-16 year-olds, and the IBDP to 16-19 year-olds. The boarding programme at UWC Thailand is open to students in grades 9-12, which cover the last two years of MYP and the IBDP. Day students are eligible to enroll at all grade levels if they are full-time residents in Phuket. 
Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa welcomes day and boarding students between the ages of 11 and 19. Students aged 11-15 attend Lower Secondary School and follow the school’s own curriculum. Students aged 15-17 are offered the Cambridge IGCSE programme, and students aged 17-19 study the IBDP. 
Please note that attending a UWC school during the younger years does not automatically grant students a place at UWC to study the IBDP later in life. All schools offering younger years programmes carefully monitor each individual student's progress to ensure that the rigorous IBDP followed as part of the two-year programme for 16-19 year-olds is the right course of study for them. 
Please contact the school of your choice for more information about younger years provision.

The campus was built in 2015 into a park-like environment, close to the north-east of Maastricht city centre. The site is surrounded by sports fields, a nature reserve and new housing. In order to access the campus, one crosses over a bridge that is only accessible to pedestrians and cyclists.
Together with its region Maastricht forms a unique part of the Netherlands. Ithas an open, multilingual, and innovative society, full of vitality. It’s also home to 30.000 students — half of whom come from outside the Netherlands.With the Belgian and German boarder close by, Maastricht is definitely the most international city of the Netherlands!
Day student applications for Primary and Secondary must meet the requirements of the Dutch Law on International Education. Residential IBDP and IBCP Diploma students are recruited through UWC's national committee system or through the UWC Global Selection Programme.

Moshi and Arusha, Tanzania
500(aged 3-20 years)
In August 2019, UWC East Africa (UWCEA) welcomed IBDP students to the 18th UWC school, the second UWC on the African continent. UWCEA was established as International School Moshi in 1969 and later opened a second campus in Arusha in 1987. Both campuses lie in the foothills of two of the biggest mountains in Africa and serve a diverse community.
Please enter some content for your news story here.
UWCEA offers all the three IB programmes: Primary Years Programme (PYP) consisting of Early Childhood to P6 for students aged 3-10, Middle Years Programme (MYP) consisting of M1-M5 for students aged 11-15, and the IBDP for students aged 16-20.  UWCEA also offers support to students with many different learning abilities. A specialist teacher concentrates on the development of students with special educational needs. ‘English as an Additional Language’ (EAL) specialists support students both in primary and secondary school.
UWCEA offers a variety of sporting activities including swimming, basketball, netball, rugby, football, and athletics. Student teams compete in various tournaments in the Kilimanjaro Region as members of the Northern Tanzania Athletics Associations (NTAA). The School also organises and hosts an annual Sports Weekend, which brings together nearly 1000 students from a dozen schools across the country to compete in team sports.
PYP students participate in clubs which typically include sports or service. All students in MYP and DP are required to participate in service and action or undertake a self-initiated project. The Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) projects vary from peer education programmes in the community to a bee farming project in West Kilimanjaro.
Mount Kilimanjaro is often the backdrop to many sports activities on both of  UWCEA Moshi’s sports fields. The campus is spread across 40 acres of land and has its own horse stable. UWCEA Moshi is home to students aged 7 years and above. 
From August 2019, UWCEA Arusha welcomes IBDP students to the newly built co-educational residence surrounded by a two-kilometre bush walking/running track.
Both UWCEA Moshi and Arusha have extensive grounds with indigenous trees and flowers. The campuses are home to numerous wildlife including colobus monkeys, hedgehogs and various birds. Both campuses have extraordinary views of freestanding mountains, which can be enjoyed for miles. 
Applicants to the Primary Years and the Middle Years Programmes need to apply to the school directly. Students who wish to apply to the IBDP at UWCEA can either do that through their UWC national committee or the UWC Global Selection Programme. For more information visit the UWCEA website.

Through supportive education and deliberate community engagement, the course aims to harness the energy and power that youth have. Through the GLF experience, participants find themselves emancipated from the idea that they cannot do anything about the problems in their community.

Vale of Glamorgan,Wales, UK
350 studentsaged 15 to 19
UWC’s founding college, UWC Atlantic was designed to promote international understanding through education since its foundation in 1962. It provides a platform for young individuals to learn through shared experience and be empowered to make a positive difference.
The two-year Diploma Programme, suitable for 16 – 19-year-olds, has two parts: the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) curriculum, and a programme of experiential learning that focuses on key aspects of peace, a sustainable future, and student initiative. They are interlinked and share a common heritage through the pioneering philosophy of Kurt Hahn, the United World College movement and the education work of Alec Peterson.
The Programme represents the mission of the College in action. It focuses on a lifelong commitment to service in the community, to collaborative work and social engagement and develops in young people a sense of personal initiative and the skills of leadership. Students are placed into positions of trust, authentic responsibility and decision making, and through action and personal example demonstrate a commitment to making a positive difference in the world.
The co-curricular program includes four experiential faculties – Environmental, Global, Social Justice, Outdoor – that allow students to engage in discovery, determine their own pathways, confront risk and overcome the possibility of failure in order to know their own strengths and fallibilities as well as their role in the common cause. Each faculty has two areas: primary delivery, which contains the community engagement program, and secondary delivery, which contains four defining features (activities, student initiatives, mission focus periods and project period).
UWC Atlantic is set in the 12th century St Donat’s Castle, a particularly unusual campus setting, hosting larger assembly and classrooms.
The student community is distributed across eight purpose-built boarding houses, accommodating approximately 48 students each, with separate male and female corridors. Generally, four students from the same year group, each of different nationality, share a room. All students are under the care of houseparents, who live in adjacent homes and spend a great deal of time interacting and supporting the students.
Campus facilities include dining hall, library, woodland, indoor and outdoor swimming pool, and classrooms within historic buildings.
UWC Atlantic is based on the southern coast of Wales in the United Kingdom. The large town of Bridgend and Wales’ capital city, Cardiff, are in fairly close proximity, meaning that the College is located within easy access of many major transport links including bus, rail and air travel.
Students can apply through their UWC national committee or through the UWC Global Selection Programme. For more information about UWC Atlantic, visit the website.

Waterford Kamhlaba UWC of Southern Africa was founded in 1963 as a response to the separate and unequal educational systems in South Africa. The property on which the School is situated was originally a farm called "Waterford Park Estate". When His Majesty King Sobhuza II, the former Ngwenyama of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), visited the school in 1967, he gave it the name "Kamhlaba", by which he meant both "of the world", a world in miniature, and also that we are "of the earth" and therefore without distinctions such as race or religion. Differently to all the other UWC schools and colleges, the academic year at Waterford Kamhlaba runs from January to November.
Waterford Kamhlaba offers three educational programmes: the Waterford curriculum in the junior school, consisting of Forms 1 to 3 (11-14 year-olds); the University of Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) program in the middle school, consisting of Forms 4 and 5 (14-16 year-olds); and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) curriculum in the senior school (16-20 year-olds).

Waterford Kamhlaba offers a wide variety of sporting activities, including athletics, badminton, basketball, cricket, hockey, netball, rugby, soccer, softball, squash, swimming, volleyball and tennis. Other recreational activities include camping, climbing, horse riding, kayaking and road as well as cross-country running. A variety of art clubs (including drama and music) and societies are run by both staff and students. Since 1979, a commitment to community service has also been formally recognized as an essential part of the school’s policy, organisation and life. A regular commitment of two hours a week to a service project is required of IBDP and Form 5 students, and projects usually vary from involvement at the local hospital, work for the disabled, at local schools and preschools, and environmental awareness activities such as a recycling program.
Ekukhuleni (the place of growing) residence accommodates up to 80 Form 1, 2 and 3 students. Esiveni (the place of the people of the nation) accommodates up to 110 Form 4 and 5 students.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - UWC Thailand
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/uwc-thailand
Phuket, Thailand
380 StudentsAged 2-18 years
Encircled by virgin rainforest, UWC Thailand sits nestled in the foothills of Phuket’s green-capped mountains, away from the island’s busy city centres. Our unique location is both symbolic and intentional; a physical reminder that in addition to academic rigour, the UWC Thailand community values global citizenship, wellness, and environmental stewardship. From monitoring coral reefs to embedding positively focused mindfulness, the betterment of our students, our community, and our planet are at the centre of everything we do.
UWC Thailand aims to realise the UWC mission by delivering a mindful, diverse education underpinned by its belief in the connection between a “Good Heart, Balanced Mind, and Healthy Body”. 
The goal of all IB schools is to create “inquiring, knowledgeable, caring young people who are motivated to succeed.” At UWC Thailand, we believe that learning comes from students engaged in the process of ‘doing’. Along this journey, we pique students’ curiosity through the use of guiding questions to help them move forward and discover answers independently. As a fully authorised International Baccalaureate Continuum School, we offer the Primary Years Programme for students aged 3-12, and the Middle Years Programme is for students aged 11-16, and for 16-19 year-olds, UWC Thailand offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) curriculum.
 
Our Nursery and Preschool programmes for students aged 2-3 years old are also grounded in IB philosophy in an age-appropriate, play-based environment. The school is also accredited by the Council of International Schools, which is recognised by Ministries, Departments of Education, and universities around the world as a demonstration of a school’s commitment to high quality, international education. Through the alignment of UWC’s Core Values and the IB Learner Profile, UWCT delivers an educational experience that: 
In an age of digital entertainment, social isolation and increasing inactivity, the need for Sport, Activities, and Outdoor and Experiential Education has never been greater. Sport is an integral part of life at UWCT, where being principled and developing good sportsmanship—rather than collecting trophies—is our main objective (though we find one frequently begets the other). At UWCT, sport not only contributes to our motto of a “Good Heart, Balanced Mind, and a Healthy Body”, but also teaches communication, leadership, time management, and the impact of collaboration and collective responsibility in a tangible way. Similarly, we view the outdoors as a classroom unto itself, where physically-challenging experiences have a powerful impact upon a young person’s intellectual, physical, spiritual, social, and moral development. Our students’ outdoor experiences—starting in Grade 1—encompass planning, preparation, and participation in a range of activities including hiking, climbing, kayaking, sailing, and mountain biking; all of which are aspects of our yearly camps and/or expeditions. To round out our student’s educational experience, UWCT offers a tremendous - and vital - array of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and Extracurricular Activities (ECAs) designed to bring students and the wider community together for learning, competition, recreation, performances, and sharing. These activities help to broaden each student’s experience and enhance their learning by developing key skills including team work, confidence, and self-management.
UWC Thailand’s campus has spacious and extensive hosting facilities for its Early Childhood, Lower Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary students. The boarding house is home to approximately 80 students from grades 9-12.Located next to Thanyapura, Asia’s leading sports and wellness facility, UWCT is accredited by the World Academy of Sport as an Athlete-Friendly Training Centre. This allows our elite athletes to extend the DP from two years to three years, in order to be able to balance demanding training schedules with the rigour of the IB. Students have access to its excellent sports facilities which include an Olympic sized swimming pool, 500m running track, rugby pitch, tennis courts, volleyball courts, mindfulness centre and cardio centre. UWCT also has the distinction of being the only boarding school adjacent to a FINA swim facility in all of Asia.
UWC Thailand is situated in the northern part of the island of Phuket. It is a 20-minute drive to the Sarasin Bridge, which connects Phuket to mainland Thailand. Phuket’s landscape is a mixture of protected national park, beaches and coastal areas, and rubber plantations with local communities.
Applicants for UWC Thailand’s Nursery, Primary and Middle school apply to the school directly. The admissions process is based on UWC’s mission and values. Students who wish to attend UWC Thailand in Grade 11 and 12 can either apply through their UWC national committee or through the UWC Global Selection Programme. It is UWC Thailand’s policy that no more than 20% of any particular nationality is represented within the community. For more information about UWC Thailand, visit the website.

It all began in 1997 with the generous gift of land and building infrastructure by Harish Mahindra of the world-renowned Mahindra & Mahindra Group. UWC Mahindra, or MUWCI (pronounced “myoo-ki”) as it is more informally known, is a vibrant college with a rich tradition of curricular innovation and community engagement. Programmes such as the IB’s World Studies Extended Essay and the Film Studies programme were conceived and piloted here. The college also houses the Akshara Foundation, which enhances the positive local impact of the college and provides students with numerous opportunities for project-based and service learning.
The campus is located on a 175-acre conservation park overlooking the Mulshi and Kolvan valleys, 150 km from Mumbai. 
Architect Christopher Benninger has won international awards for the campus design, based on local architecture and which uses regional materials.
Classrooms are based around a quadrangle and each has its own courtyard. The hall, library, arts centre, science laboratories, catering and administrative centres are in this central area.
Since 2000, staff, students and faculty have planted over 100,000 trees on campus, making it a shady and green space to live and learn. 
UWC Mahindra College offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) curriculum. Alongside standard courses, the college offers Visual Art, Theatre, Film, Psychology, Philosophy and Global Politics. Mandatory inputs and sessions on political, socio-emotional, place-based, and outdoor education are part of the MUWCI Core.
UWC Mahindra also offers the Project Based Certificate (PBC) along with a Cambridge Pre-University Diploma. The PBC is a specialised programme, where a selected group of students takes the IBDP curriculum during their first year and utilises the second year to conceive and execute a real-world, impact-driven project.
UWC Mahindra College offers an immense variety of co-curricular activities through its Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) programme, referred to as “Triveni” programme.
Creativity is an integral part of learning at MUWCI. And the college offers multiple avenues to exercise its creative muscle through performance (music, dance and theatre) and writing.
Community Service on campus and beyond happens through participation in Triveni projects, as well by working with the Akshara Program and local community initiatives in the valley. These include working with local schools, entrepreneurship programs, organic farming collectives and non-governmental organizations.
Besides regular sports such as basketball and football, the geographical location of the campus fosters an ideal setting for outdoor activities like hiking, cycling and fire service. A large number of students also participate in physically challenging outings during Travel Week and the inter-house sporting season known as MUWCILympics.
UWC Mahindra College conducts several short programs during the summer break which bring together 14-18 year-old students from around the world to learn about issues such as sustainability, globalization and gender. The primary focus is on providing students with a comprehensive introduction to important issues through interaction with field experts and making use of MUWCI’s geographical and cultural context.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - UWC South East Asia
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/uwc-south-east-asia
Singapore
5,600 StudentsAged 4–18 years
Opened in 1971 as Singapore International School by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, UWC South East Asia (UWCSEA) became a full member of the UWC movement in 1975, expanding to include Primary students as young as 4 in the 1990s and adding a second campus in 2011. UWCSEA today extends over two campuses, welcoming students from over 100 nationalities to communities of day and boarding students. The multilingual community is enriched each year by an intake of 600-800 new students who join at all grade-levels.
 
As both the starting point and the end goal of a UWCSEA education, the UWC mission guides every decision about learning. The educational goal to provide a holistic, values-based education that supports students to develop as individuals and as members of a global society is the basis of all classroom learning and shapes the content in the academic curriculum.
The wellbeing and learning principles create an environment in which students can develop knowledge and understanding through the five elements of the UWCSEA learning programme, which consists of five interlinking elements: academics, activities, outdoor education, personal and social education, and service. While students do not spend an equal amount of time on each of the elements (for much of the year, the academic element takes up most of the day), equal value is placed on them. 
The programme strives to give each student age-appropriate opportunities to develop qualities and skills, and the concept-based K-12 curriculum is common across both campuses. Students are led through age-appropriate learning across each academic discipline, with the intent to develop knowledge that will support successful study in the IB Diploma in Grade 11 and 12, and beyond. 
An extensive Home Languages Programme supports multilingual students of all ages who are speakers of languages other than English to maintain their home language. It’s aim is to create opportunities for students to maintain and develop both academic and communicative language skills should the student wish to join the bespoke UWCSEA First Language Programme offered in the Grade 9 and 10 academic programme in preparation for study of the language in the IBDP.UWCSEA’s High Schools offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) for Grade 11 and 12. Students joining the College in Grade 9 complete a two-year programme, while a Foundation IB course is offered to students joining in Grade 10. Alongside standard courses, UWCSEA offers Dutch, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and Russian language options, and Design Technology, Computer Science, Environmental Systems and Societies, Global Politics, Psychology, Philosophy, Sports Exercise and Health Science, Dance, Film, Music, Visual Arts and Theatre.
UWCSEA’s learning environment has been crafted to support well-being and therefore effective learning, with a focus on ensuring each student feels valued, cared for, secure and supported. The aim is to help students develop strong social and emotional skills so they are better equipped to manage themselves, relate to others, develop resilience and a sense of self-worth, resolve conflict, engage in teamwork and feel positive about themselves and the world around them.
Students are regularly given opportunities to observe and investigate the natural world around them while safely challenging their own capabilities, both independently and in collaboration with others. For all grades, this includes exploring the campus gardens and other natural spaces as part of the school day.
All students are engaged in age-appropriate, service learning activities, linked directly to our K–12 curriculum, as well as to other elements of our UWCSEA learning programme. While the service interactions across our campuses are different, regardless of campus, school, grade or classroom, all students are striving in each of the three areas of learning identified in our service curriculum:
Developing compassion and responsibility, the Service programme allows students to put UWC values into action as they engage in rewarding experiential learning opportunities guided by the service learning curriculum.
At the very heart of the UWC mission, service enables students to actively contribute to resolving social and environmental problems, both locally and globally. As students deepen their understanding of why these problems exist, they are guided to realise that everyone can play a part in taking informed, purposeful action to resolve them.
Both within and beyond the campuses, all students also take on experiential challenges that build resilience, collaboration and leadership through a carefully planned incremental progression of age-appropriate Outdoor Education experiences. 
Opportunities for learning are then extended as students take on experiential challenges that build resilience, collaboration and leadership. Whether exploring the natural environment on campus in K1, learning about water filtration in Grade 3 or taking on our High Ropes course in Grade 8, students develop confidence in their physical abilities and the emotional resilience to withstand difficult situations.
Achievements in outdoor education are recorded through student reflections and demonstrated in the character, skills, qualities and maturity that students develop and apply across all aspects of the learning programme and in their lives. UWCSEA is partnering with Oregon State University-Cascades to conduct a longitudinal study into the impacts of outdoor education. Interim findings present compelling evidence in support of the long-term benefits for students of an intentional Outdoor Education programme.
Another vital part of student life and learning, the multifaceted Activities programme provides students with opportunities to explore new interests, develop their strengths and pursue their passions. They can do this through existing activities, or by finding students and staff who will join them in starting a new one as they make like-minded friends and interact with students from other grades and parts of the school.
The Initiative for Peace (IfP) was founded in 2001 to promote peace in global, national and regional conflicts. The annual conferences are hosted by Grade 11 students following a year of preparation. Students from both campuses receive training from specialists in the fields of public administration, conflict resolution and negotiation, and historical perspectives in order to facilitate events for youth leaders from the host country.
UWCSEA has made an IfP toolkit available for educators and other youth leadership organisations who wish to replicate and adapt the programme in their own context and communities. 
Both campuses offer exceptional facilities suited to the hands-on and technologically integrated learning programme. From classrooms, resource centres and libraries equipped with state-of-the-art technology and tools, to professionally equipped performance spaces, to outstanding sporting facilities, the environment has been designed to support all five elements of the UWCSEA learning programme.
Whether purpose built, as in the East Campus, or having reimagined existing infrastructure on the site of the former St. John’s Army School in the case of Dover Campus, both locations have shared learning spaces that help to create a community. Age-appropriate facilities allow all students multiple opportunities to access authentic learning experiences in their immediate environment.
The GreenMark Platinum Super Low Energy certification held by both campuses means they have achieved the highest ‘green building’ standard in Singapore, and continue to operate within benchmarks set to contribute to Singapore’s ambitious sustainability goals. Environmental and design aspects of the buildings are integrated into the learning programme wherever possible, helping to bring to life both systems thinking for students and the College’s sustainability agenda to develop students as environmental stewards.
Dover Campus was established in the existing St John’s Army School in 1971, and features many mature trees and plenty of open spaces. While the campus has transformed over a multi-year refurbishment project, the Tent Plaza remains the social heart of the campus. There are three boarding houses, Kurt Hahn House, Nelson Mandela House and Malala Yousafzai House,  which host over 190 boarders in Grades 8 to 12.
Opened in August 2011, the East Campus is a purpose-built facility that, in keeping with UWC’s sustainability goal, continues to set global benchmarks in design, innovation, accessibility and environmental impact for schools. Tampines House, a multi-story boarding house that overlooks the campus, hosts about 160 students in Grades 8 to 12.
Dover Campus occupies 11 hectares in Clementi, west of the central business district and next to the National University of Singapore. The East Campus is set on 5.5 hectares in Tampines, a fast-developing northeastern hub near Changi Airport.
Most students are admitted directly, taking into account the UWC mission by deliberately recruiting students who are committed to the mission and vision of the School from a diverse array of backgrounds, nationalities and life experiences. Scholarship students are in most cases selected via the UWC national committee system. Most of them join for the two-year IBDP, however, a smaller number of students join on 5 or 3-year scholarships (in Grade 8 or Grade 10) to be granted appropriate preparation for the IBDP.

Changshu, China
570 StudentsAged 15 - 18 years
UWC Changshu China was founded in 2015 as the first UWC in the mainland of China on the initiative of a UWC alum, Mark Jiapeng Wang. Since its opening, the College has grown considerably and is today home to 443 students. UWC Changshu China consists of Grades 10, 11 and 12 with most international students attending UWC Changshu for Grades 11 and 12.
UWC Changshu China offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) curriculum, and a Pre-IBDP Program for Grade 10 students.
The Pre-IBDP Program aims at allowing students to acquire the skills and knowledge needed for successful entry into the IBDP program.
Within the IBDP curriculum, alongside standard courses, UWC Changshu offers foundation Chinese language programs (for international students), Geography, Economics, Philosophy, Global Perspectives, Chinese Studies, Theatre, Visual Arts, Spanish, French and German.
UWC Changshu China named the Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) program Zhi Xing, which means ‘learning by doing’ as well as ‘putting knowledge into action’. It enables the exploration of Chinese culture within the School and through interactions with the wider community. Many of the activities, such as Chinese performing arts, calligraphy, or Chinese musical instruments, have a direct focus on Chinese culture, allowing international students to understand Chinese culture holistically. Such activities also provide opportunities for Chinese students to share and further explore their own culture. Other activities, such as volunteering in local homes for the aged, schools and community centers, stretch the boundaries of our students’ education to include local Chinese culture, people and environment.
Project weeks are an invaluable learning opportunity for the students, which allow them to put UWC values into action. Happening once a year, students get to explore a remote area of China. Members of the faculty lead IBDP students to less developed regions of China to participate in a week of public service. Students have the opportunity to interact with the local community through teaching, outreach and other community oriented activities. These trips also grant students insight into the different levels of economic development in China.
Designed by Mo Ping, the protégé of I.M. Pei, the 24-acre campus is built on an island on the northwest side of Kuncheng Lake. In architectural design, the campus is a reminiscent of a southern Chinese waterside village, where connections between all parts are seamless and unobstructed.

Title: UWC Zimbabwe - UWC Robert Bosch College
 Reference link: https://www.zw.uwc.org/rbc
Freiburg, Germany
200 StudentsAged 16 - 19 years
UWC Robert Bosch College is a joint project of the Deutsche Stiftung UWC as well as the Robert Bosch Stiftung. Located in Freiburg, Germany‘s “green city“, the College has a special focus on sustainability, which is embedded in academics, student life and the architecture of the buildings. The proximity to the Black Forest National Park further allows for a well-rounded outdoor program. Deliberate diversity is the College’s main goal. For this purpose, it currently provides 70% of its student body with full scholarships, thanks to funding from the state ministry, the Robert Bosch Stiftung, B.Braun Melsungen AG as well as many other foundations and individuals.
UWC Robert Bosch College offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) curriculum. Given the College’s focus on sustainability, the Natural Sciences play an important role, as does the field of Mathematics. Apart from other standard courses, the College offers Arabic, World Arts and Cultures, Political Thought, the History of Asia and Oceania. Classes at RBC tend to be small, with an average of 10-12 students per course.
The Creativity and Activity sections include a wide range of often student led activities, such as baking, blogging, improvising with the A-Capella group, performing at city institutions with the RBC string ensemble, debating or international vegan cooking, ballroom or Bollywood dancing, soccer, bouldering, yoga or Taekwondo.
The College works with 26 institutions and organizations situated in the city of Freiburg, including schools, kindergartens, refugee camps, social services for the homeless, care homes and ecological institutions. Once a week, instead of class, students visit one of these projects.
Twice a year, during Project Week, students participate in projects that need to be bound to a learning outcome and can be a social service, an activity or a creativity.
Four times a year, the College suspends classes and organizes Special Focus Days for the whole community. These days include presentations, workshops and speeches around one single theme, such as Interfaith Dialogue, Democracy, Justice and Injustice or Sustainability.
Integrated in the curriculum, Global Affairs are additional sessions targeted at dealing with questions of our time – from politics to religion, economy or social studies or cultural trends - often involving known keynote speakers.
Finally, the campus functions as a community: every student is encouraged to choose an area of interest within the College and to contribute to its maintenance, including library, the garden, or the communications office. Finding ways to be helpful and doing a service to the community is just another way of social engagement.
UWC Robert Bosch College is housed in an old monastery, which was renovated and partly rebuilt by the Robert Bosch Stiftung. The classrooms, the library as well as the art and fitness rooms and the labs are located in the historic building, which dates back to 1850. The top floor additionally hosts staff and teaching rooms, offices and a room of silence, where yoga and meditation sessions take place and where students can pray individually.
The Kartaus is surrounded by orchards, grassland and a historic monastery garden, which is cultivated by students and staff in an organic way. Dating back to 1340, the garden was first set up by Carthusian monks and has been restored to this date. Today, the garden is deeply rooted in RBC’s sustainability mission and approach and is considered its “green classroom“.
Behind the old monastery, a newly constructed building hosts the Mensa and the Auditorium. The Mensa is run by an NGO called “Dreisamwerke“, which operates on an inclusive basis and provides jobs to people with disabilities. Every student is expected to help with kitchen service on a rotational basis.
The student village is located opposite the Kartaus and has been built deliberately to set a contrast to the historic building. 8 student houses and 4 staff houses in the shape of cubes form the “village“. Each house offers a different perspective on the surrounding, a reflection of the diversity within: 24 students share a house, 4 one room. The three-story houses host a common room with a kitchen shared by all as well as two residential floors, each with their own bathroom. All buildings are passive houses and constructed according to Freiburg’s very high energy efficiency standards.
UWC Robert Bosch College is located in Freiburg, Germany, on the edge of the Black Forest, only 30 minutes from the border to France and Switzerland.
Students apply through their UWC national committee. Since 2014, the College also offers two additional scholarships per year to students with a refugee background. For more information about UWC Robert Bosch College, visit the  website.
